# KiroSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

KiroSpec is the only official spec source for this repository.

When the request involves planning, proposals, scope changes, architecture shifts, or anything ambiguous:
- Read the relevant specs under `@/.kiro/specs/` first
- Apply constraints in `@/KIRO_FREEZE_PROMPT.md` when present

When implementing work:
- Follow the task order in the relevant `tasks.md`
- Keep behavior aligned with `requirements.md` and `design.md` in the same spec folder
